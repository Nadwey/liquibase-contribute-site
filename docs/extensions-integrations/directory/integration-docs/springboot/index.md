# Using Liquibase with Spring Boot

The purpose of this tutorial is to guide you through the process of using Liquibase as part of your [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/) workflow. Spring Boot makes it easy to create standalone, production grade Spring-based applications.

## Uses

Spring Boot allows you to create Java applications that can be started by using `java -jar` or `war` deployments.

With Spring Boot, some of the heavy lifting of configuring beans to set up things like messaging, database connection, migration, and others are already done for you. You only need to add the correct jar file on the classpath to be picked up by the framework for auto-configuration.

Some Spring Boot features include Profiles, Logging, Security, Caching, Spring Integration, Testing, and more.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Java Development Kit [(JDK 14+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html))
